Correlation in the two pieces of message

When finding match probabilty write about markov chain and relation to information theory

Try to relate as much as possible to information theory instead of forcing information theory into the algorithm 

Correlations if possible but might be difficult

Use information theory to get more efficiency

Compare eq 18.24 to Kullback Leibler divergence
